| `npm run preview`   | Serve the production build locally                 |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript type checking                           |
| `npm test`          | Run unit tests once                                |

## Debug tools

Press the **backtick key** (`` ` ``) in game, or open the page with `?debug` in the URL.

- **Overlay** (top left): FPS, frame time, simulation tick, plus any value a system reports.
- **Tuning panel** (top right): live controls for every value in
  [`assets/data/tuning.json`](assets/data/tuning.json). When something feels right, click
  **Copy tuning JSON** and paste it into the file.

In dev, saving `tuning.json` hot-reloads the values without restarting the game.
