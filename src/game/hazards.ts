/**
 * Course hazards and creatures for Blender tracks, driven by track.json entities and
 * the collision surfaces under the wheels:
 *
 *   lava        a burning bounce (think of a cartoon hop off a hot stove): an upward
 *               kick, a push back towards the road, a sizzle and a yelp, and a speed
 *               penalty. You keep steering in the air, and you're immune for a moment
 *               after. Burn yourself three times in a few seconds and you're put back
 *               at the last checkpoint, held still briefly (the time penalty).
 *   deep water  a splash, then you bob in the water, slow, and are fished out at the
 *               last checkpoint after a moment. Shallow water is just a slow surface
 *               (with a splash going in).
 *   respawn     { "type": "respawn", "from": 820, "to": 845, "at": 852 }: falling in
 *               while between `from` and `to` along the lap (a jump's gap) puts you
 *               back at `at` instead of the last checkpoint, so a missed jump never
 *               loops.
 *   dinosaur    { "type": "dinosaur", "route": "Dino Path", "speed": 2.2 }: a friendly
 *               long-neck that walks round a path from route.json (draw it in Blender
 *               as a curve and mark it as a route). It stops when a kart comes close,
 *               nudges karts aside (it never traps them) and never jumps about.
 *               "model": "mammoth" makes it a woolly mammoth instead.
 *   waterfall   { "type": "waterfall", "x", "y", "z", "top", "width", "heading", "sound"? }:
 *               spray at its foot and its roar nearby; driving through it splashes.
 *   campfire    { "type": "campfire", "x", "y", "z" }: smoke and embers rising from a
 *               little bonfire (the fire itself is scenery). Purely visual.
 *   torch       { "type": "torch", "x", "y", "z" }: a torch flame (the torch is scenery).
 *               The few torches nearest the camera cast flickering warm light on the
 *               road, the walls and the karts, and drop the odd ember. Purely visual.
 *   bubbles     { "type": "bubbles", "x", "y", "z", "r", "molten"? }: a bubbling pool: glowing
 *               bubbles rising and popping over it, and now and then a big burp of
 *               swamp gas ("molten": true: orange lava bubbles and spatter). Purely
 *               visual.
 *   fireflies   { "type": "fireflies", "rate": 40, "radius": 36 }: little glowing
 *               motes drifting in the air round the camera. Purely visual.
 *   dragon      { "type": "dragon", ... } (see game/dragon.ts): a fire-breathing dragon on
 *               a fixed schedule from the race clock. Its fire burns exactly like
 *               lava (the same bounce, immunity and three-strikes respawn).
 *   eruption    { "type": "eruption", "x", "y", "z", "period": 12, "offset": 0 }: a
 *               volcano erupting on a fixed beat of the race clock: a rumble, then a
 *               blast of glowing lava bombs and a flash of red light, with a fountain
 *               of fire between. Purely visual.
 *   storm       { "type": "storm", "period": 9, "spread": 5, "distance": 900 } (see
 *               game/storm.ts): lightning forking down round the horizon now and then, a
 *               white-blue flash over everything and the thunder after. Purely visual.
 *   ashfall     { "type": "ashfall", "rate": 60, "radius": 40 }: grey ash drifting down
 *               and embers floating up round the camera. Purely visual.
 *   steam       { "type": "steam", "x", "y", "z" }: a vent puffing steam. Purely visual.
 *   snowball    { "type": "snowball", ... } (see game/movers.ts): a giant snowball rolling
 *               across the road on a fixed beat of the race clock. It's solid: hit it and
 *               you bounce off and slow down, like hitting the long-neck.
 *   sleigh      { "type": "sleigh", ... } (see game/movers.ts): a sleigh and two reindeer
 *               crossing the road on a fixed beat, bells jingling first. Solid, likewise.
 *   present     { "type": "present", "x", "y", "z", "size": 2.4, "variant": 0,
 *               "heading": 0 }: a big wrapped present by the road. Drive into it and it
 *               bursts into confetti and gives you a small boost (the session fires a
 *               level 1 blue balloon's boost on `smashed`); it's back a while later.
 *   bell        { "type": "bell", ... } (see game/movers.ts): the bell tower's bell,
 *               swinging and ringing on a fixed beat. Purely visual (and audible).
 *   ornament    { "type": "ornament", "x", "y", "z", "r": 1.5, "color": "#d82a3a" }: a
 *               giant bauble slowly turning and bobbing. Purely visual.
 *   chimney     { "type": "chimney", "x", "y", "z" }: smoke curling from a chimney.
 *   lantern     { "type": "lantern", "x", "y", "z" }: like a torch (it lights the scene
 *               when near), but a steady lantern glow: no embers.
 *   Snow powder puffs up behind karts driving through deep snow.
 *   geyser      { "type": "geyser", ... } (see game/geyser.ts): a hot spring blowing on a
 *               fixed beat of the race clock. A kart in its column as it blows is thrown
 *               into the air (keeping its speed: a free jump).
 *   icicle, thin_ice, shimmer, sparkles (see game/rift.ts): Aurora Rift's icicles that
 *               drop on a beat (a knock if you're under one), lake ice that cracks and
 *               gives way into slowing slush, crystals that flare as you pass, and ice
 *               motes glinting in the air.
 *   dust, dustwind, windmill, birds (see game/desert.ts): Desert World's dust kicked up
 *               behind karts on dirt and sand, dust blowing across the land, a ranch
 *               windmill's turning wheel and big birds circling over the canyon.
 *   boat, fountain (see game/oasis.ts): Oasis Haven's little sailing boats going round
 *               the lake on paths from route.json, with wakes, and fountains' jets.
 *   minecart    { "type": "minecart", ... } (see game/movers.ts): a runaway ore cart rattling
 *               across the mine's workings on a fixed beat, waiting glowing (and rattling)
 *               in the side tunnel first. Solid, like the sleigh.
 *   ghost, ghostrider, railcart, tumbleweed, door, wisps, mist, whispers, creak,
 *   ambience    (see game/haunt.ts): Dry Gulch's haunting: see-through ghosts at windows,
 *               over the graves and in the mine, the ghost rider on the far ridge, an ore
 *               cart rolling along the railway by itself, tumbleweeds bowling across the
 *               road, the saloon's doors swinging, green wisps and mist, whispers, creaking
 *               timber, and the night wind that falls away underground.
 *   pterosaur   { "type": "pterosaur", "route": "Flyer Path", "speed": 13, "scale": 1.6 }:
 *               a pterosaur circling high over the course along a route (its height
 *               comes from the route), flapping and gliding, banking into turns, with
 *               a cry now and then. Purely visual: it never comes down to the karts.
 *
 * Nothing here changes how the kart drives: it only reacts to where the kart is, the
 * way an item hit does (a vertical kick, a slower speed, a respawn).
